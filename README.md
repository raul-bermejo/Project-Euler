# Project-Euler


## About
In this repo I will post my solutions of the Project Euler, a community where people solve mathematical modelling problems. I will attempt to solve a problem a day, bearing in mind that the higher the problem number the higher it will be. I will try to solve the problems in either Python or C++ (langauges I am most comfortable in). In some cases, I will try to solve the problem in both languages and see how computation time is affected.

## Dependencies

One needs to have Python installed and a C++ compiler (such as GNU for the latter).

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Also, suggestions for code optimzation are very welcome too. After all, that is the point of the Euler Project.
